    <h1>NeoForge: Joining an External Server</h1>

    <p class="alert alert-warning">
      The NeoForge mod is in early alpha. It may experience more mod incompatibilities than expected.
      Additionally, some instructions relating to the Crowd Control app may be unavailable as we roll out support.
    </p>

    <p>The following steps are for streamers who are connecting to another individual's server.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download and install the <a href="https://crowdcontrol.live/">Crowd Control app</a>.</li>
      <li>In the <strong>Game Selection</strong> tab, select <strong>Minecraft</strong>.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Configure Minecraft</strong>.</li>
      <li>Enter your Minecraft username and click next.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Remote</strong>.</li>
      <li>Enter the IP address of the server (usually the same as the one you connect to in Minecraft) and click next.</li>
      <li>If you were provided a secret passphrase by the server administrator, enter it here. Otherwise, leave the default value of <code>crowdcontrol</code>. Click next.</li>
      <li>The checklist should now all have green checks.
        <ul>
          <li>If you are the server owner and are seeing Awaiting Connector or Connector Error, make sure the port 58431 is open on the server's firewall. If you are assigned a random port, make sure to specify that port in the mod's config file.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>(Optional) For extra effects and the best experience, install the client mod using the <NuxtLink to="/guide/neoforge/client">Client Setup</NuxtLink> guide.</li>
      <li>Join the Minecraft server in your game (usually using the same IP as the one you entered in step 7).</li>
      <li>(Optional) If you're sharing effects with another streamer, run the command <code>/account link INSERT_USERNAME</code> to receive their effects. The username should come from what's displayed in the top left corner of their Crowd Control app.</li>
      <li>Select <strong>Start Session</strong> in the Crowd Control app.
        <ul>
          <li>If you are the server owner and the button is greyed out, make sure the server is using the latest version of the mod.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Open the <strong>Effect Manager</strong> in the Crowd Control app to test effects.</li>
    </ol>
