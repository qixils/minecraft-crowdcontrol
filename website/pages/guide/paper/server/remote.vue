    <h1>Paper {{ version }} Remote Server Setup</h1>

    <p class="alert alert-warning" v-if="!supported">
      The selected Minecraft version is no longer receiving mod updates.
      Please consider updating to {{ paperLatest }}.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following steps detail how to set up a Minecraft {{ version }} remote Paper server with Crowd Control.
      It is expected that you have already rented a remote server through a service like
      <a href="https://bloom.host/">bloom.host</a>.

      Note that no free hosts that we are aware of, including Aternos,
      support the firewall features necessary to use Crowd Control.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>In your admin panel, setup a Paper {{ version }} server. Spigot is not supported.</li>
      <li>In the file upload panel, create a new folder named <code>plugins</code>.</li>
      <li>Download the latest build of <a :href="`https://modrinth.com/mod/crowdcontrol/versions?l=paper&g=${version}`">Crowd Control</a> and upload it to the <code>plugins</code> folder.</li>
      <li>(Optional) Upload any other Paper plugins you want to play with into the <code>plugins</code> folder.
        <ul>
          <li>(Optional) Pre-generating chunks using a plugin like <a :href="`https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky/versions?g=${version}&l=paper`">Chunky</a> is recommended for optimal performance.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="mb-1">In the firewall/ports panel, open the port 58431 so that users may connect to the Crowd Control server.</span>
        <UAccordion
          color="primary"
          variant="soft"
          size="sm"
          :items="[{
            label: 'Setup for non-dedicated IPs',
            icon: 'i-heroicons-information-circle',
            slot: 'nondedicated',
          }, {
            label: 'Setup for free server hosts (Aternos)',

            slot: 'free',
          }]"
        >
          <template #nondedicated>
            If you aren't paying for a dedicated IP address then you will likely will be unable to choose a specific port to open and instead get assigned a random one.
            You will have to update the plugin's config file, as described below, to use your assigned port.
            You should also be sure to use your assigned port in the Crowd Control app at the end of the host field,
            i.e. for IP <code>1.2.3.4</code> and port <code>5678</code>, you would connect to <code>1.2.3.4:5678</code>.

          <template #free>
            No free hosts that we are aware of, including Aternos, support the firewall features necessary to use Crowd Control.
            If you need a free host, <a :href="`/guide/neoforge/server/local?v=${version}`">use your computer</a>.
            Otherwise, you can rent a server from a service like <a href="https://bloom.host">bloom.host</a>.
          </template>
        </UAccordion>
      </li>
      <li>Run the Minecraft server.</li>
      <li>(Optional) To edit the plugin's config file, you must first shut down the server using <code>/stop</code>. The config file can be found at <code>&lt;root&gt;/plugins/CrowdControl/config.yml</code>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Users may now connect using the <NuxtLink :to="`/guide/paper/join?v=${version}`"><strong>Joining a Server</strong></NuxtLink> guide. Make sure to provide the server's IP address and the password used in the config file (default: <code>crowdcontrol</code>) to your streamers.</p>

    <p>For extra security, consider enabling a user whitelist using the vanilla <code>/whitelist</code> command. This prevents unknown players from joining the server and potentially griefing your builds.</p>
