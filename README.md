# Minecraft Crowd Control
Minecraft Crowd Control is a plugin for [Paper](https://papermc.io/) 1.18 that allows your Twitch
community to interact with your game.

This version of the plugin is to be used with [crowdcontrol.live](https://crowdcontrol.live) which
allows viewers to control your game via bits or channel points.

Commands are fully compatible with multiplayer servers. Everyone online will be affected to some extent.

## Manual Installation

If you are hosting a server for streamers to join, you may use the following steps to setup a Minecraft server running with Crowd Control.

1. Download and install [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot).
2. Download the latest version of [Paper](https://papermc.io/downloads) 1.18. Spigot is not
   supported.
3. Place the Paper jar in a new, empty folder. This folder will hereafter be referred to as the "
   root folder."
4. Create a new folder named `plugins` inside the root folder.
5. Download the [latest plugin jar](https://github.com/qixils/minecraft-crowdcontrol/releases/latest) and place it into the `plugins` folder.
6. Run the Minecraft server. You will have to run it twice, as the first will prompt you to accept Minecraft's End User License Agreement by editing `eula.txt`. To run the server:
    - On Windows, hold shift and right click inside the root folder. From the context menu, select "Open command window here" or "Open PowerShell here".
    - After opening your command window, run the command `java -Xmx2G -Xms2G -jar paper.jar nogui` (by typing that in and pressing enter)
    - When running for the first time you will have to edit the file `eula.txt` in a program like Notepad or `nano` and then run the command again.
7. A password must be set to run the server in Server Mode, allowing multiple streamers to connect.
    - The `config.yml` file can be found inside the `<root>/plugins/CrowdControl` folder.
    - Enter a password into the `password` field
8. Ensure the ports 25565 and 58431 so that users may connect to the Minecraft server and its Crowd Control server.
9. Pre-generating chunks using a plugin like [Chunkmaster](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chunkmaster.71351/) is recommended for optimal performance.

Users may now connect using the ["Streamer Setup (External Server)" steps below](https://github.com/qixils/minecraft-crowdcontrol#streamer-setup-external-server). Make sure to provide your public IP address and the password used in the config file to your streamers.

For extra security, consider enabling a user whitelist using the vanilla `/whitelist` command.

## Streamer Setup (External Server)

The following steps are for streamers who are connecting to another individual's server.

1. Download and install the [Crowd Control PC app](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).
2. In the **Game Selection** tab, select **Minecraft (Server) (PC)**.
3. Click **Start**. A pop-up menu will appear prompting you for information that you should have received from your server administrator.
    - In the host field, you should enter an IP address or a website URL. This will usually be the same as the IP address that you connect to in Minecraft.
    - In the password field, you must enter a secret passphrase provided to you by the server administrator.
4. Upon joining the Minecraft server, run the command `/account link <your twitch username>` to ensure you receive effects that viewers purchase for you.

## Streamer Setup (Local Server)

The following steps are for streamers who are playing alone.

1. Download and install the [Crowd Control PC app](https://crowdcontrol.live/setup).
2. In the Game Selection tab, select **Minecraft (Server) (PC)**.
3. Click **One Click Server Setup** to automatically setup a server. This may take several minutes to complete.
4. Once done, click **Launch Server** to start the Minecraft server. If you were not already prompted to do so during setup, you may need to set a temporary password to be able to connect to the server. This can be done by typing `password <insert password here>` in the pop-up server console window.
5. Once the Minecraft server has started, click **Start** in the Crowd Control app to connect to the server. You may also join the Minecraft server in your game.
6. Upon joining the Minecraft server, run the command `/account link <your twitch username>` to ensure you receive effects that viewers purchase for you.
